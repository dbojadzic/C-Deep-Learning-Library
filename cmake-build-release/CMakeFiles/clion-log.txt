-- --------------+--------------------------------------------------------------
-- Command       |   Description

-- make install  | Install Eigen. Headers will be installed to:
--               |     <CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/<INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR>
--               |   Using the following values:

--               |     INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR:  include/eigen3
--               |   Change the install location of Eigen headers using:
--               |     cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=yourprefix
--               |   Or:
--               |     cmake . -DINCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR=yourdir
